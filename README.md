Description:

    This was the final project for our Java Development class.
    The idea of the project was to show off a multipage Gui Application.
    The Project itself is a student class planner that will allow the student to select classes into a schedule for future terms.
    Students will be able to create an account, log in, edit their schedule, and save their progress

Deliverables:
1.Project functional requirement and scope document:
Work as a team, pick a project idea, then discuss the desirable features/functionalities of the application as if you are the users.   Pick 3-6 features that will be included in your project. 
Write a project functional requirement document, which should include the project description and describe the 3-6 features that you have picked for your application.  Any additional features can be listed in the document as future enhancement. 
2.Design Document:
Check with the instructor on your project scope to make sure it is appropriate.  Then design the project considering GUI, classes and data.   Make sure your design will support the functionalities listed in your project functionality requirement document.   
Write a design document that includes GUI design of all the screens/forms, Inheritance hierarchy diagram, class UML diagram and use case flow chart. 
You may reference Model-View-Controller (MVC) design patterns in your design process.

3.Program code:
Based on your design, write JAVA programs to implement your design.  Save all the source code to be included in the final project document. 
4.Test plan and result:
Write up test plans for your project, test your programs follow the test plan. Save program output/screenshots.  
Project Submission: Final Project Documentation: 
Make sure that your application works well and meets the requirement of the project.  Then combine all the documents together into the final project document.  Please check out the follow for formal software project documents templates and samples.

Your project documentation is a brief version and should have the following:
1.a cover page with the name of your application, version number, date and the names of your team members.
2.table of contents
3.a section for functional requirement (this is the deliverables #1)
4.a section for project design (this is the deliverables #2)
5.a section for source code (this is the deliverables #3)
6.a section for test plan and results (this is the deliverables #4)
7.a brief summary 
Project Demo:
During the week before the finals week, we will have a project showcase where teams will demo the projects in class.
