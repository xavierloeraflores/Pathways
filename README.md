Description
    This was the final project for our Java Development class.
    The idea of the project was to show off a multipage Gui Application.
    The Project itself is a student class planner that will allow the student to select classes into a schedule for future terms.
    Students will be able to create an account, log in, edit their schedule, and save their progress
